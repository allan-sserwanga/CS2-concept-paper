\subsection{Aim and Objective}
\subsubsection{General Objective }{The major goal is to provide algorithms that process concurrently for finding strongly connected components \cite{ref1} with less time consumption and this can be done by parallelizing the algorithm}
\subsubsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{itemize}

\item	To find the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a graph (the maximal subsets S of the graph’s nodes such that for any pair of nodes there is a path from one node to another).

\item To find which nodes are part of a cycle in the graph (such that there is a non-empty path from the node to itself).

\item  To find which nodes are part of a “lasso” (such that there is a path from the node to a node on a cycle).
\end{itemize}
